# Kafka Zookepeer monitor

Kafa is a very good message platform. What is lacks is a simple monitoring tools to let me know what is going on.
There is [confluent](https://www.confluent.io/) but i costs money.
The other utils that I have used are:

### [kafka-manager](https://github.com/yahoo/kafka-manager) 
This utilitiy is very nice but only supports kafak up to version 0.9 

### [Trifecta](https://github.com/ldaniels528/trifecta)
This utility is very good, but mainly allows to view the zookeeper tree, and messages in broker.
There is no diagnostics utilites
